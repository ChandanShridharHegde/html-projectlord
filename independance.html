<h2>Symbol of India’s Independence Movement :</h2>
<ul>
   <li> The festival is said to have been revitalized later in the 19th century as a symbol of India’s independence movement, by freedom fighter<strong> Bal Gangadhar Tilak.</strong> </li>

<li>In 1892, the cities of Pune and Mumbai became packed with devotees, despite the fact that such large gatherings were not allowed by the British.</li>
<li>The 10-day festival was celebrated with a patriotic gusto fueled by a united deep devotion and love for Ganesha. </li>

<li>To this day, Hindu festivals continue to be celebrated with similar pomp and fervor, signifying the everlasting power such devotion can generate.
</ul>
